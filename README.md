# 2nd milestone: Ruby Linter

In this project i've created a Ruby Linter wich can detect and inform about diferent errors in a ruby file, those are:

1. Line has more than 100 characters

2. whitespace before or after parentheses, brackets and braces

3. whitespace before or after an assignment operator

4. wrong indentation level

# Examples

- ``` x = [    1, 2] ``` will show an error <br />
but ``` x = [1, 2] ``` will not
 
- ```sum1 = 1 +  2``` will show an error <br />
but ```sum1 = 1 + 2``` will not

- ``` front = "something"``` will show an error <br />
```front = "something"```

## How to use

1. Download this files

2. run the main file using this line in the terminal: ruby "write the path here"

3 - now write the path of the file you want to check

## Built With

- Ruby, RSpec.
