# 2nd milestone: Ruby Linter

In this project i've created a Ruby Linter wich can detect and inform about diferent errors in a ruby file, those are:

1. Line has more than 100 characters

2. whitespace before or after parentheses, brackets and braces

3. whitespace before or after an assignment operator

4. wrong indentation level

# Examples

``` x = [    1, 2] ``` will show an error <br />
but ``` x = [1, 2] ``` will not
